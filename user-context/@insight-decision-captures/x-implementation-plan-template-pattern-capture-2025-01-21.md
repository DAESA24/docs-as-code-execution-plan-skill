# Session Capture: Implementation Plan Template Pattern

## Synthesis

This session clarified a critical distinction in the docs-as-code execution plan workflow: **implementation plans are inputs, not outputs**. The initial attempt to create a "Move Tool to PBC" template duplicated the execution plan structure, which is the job of the docs-as-code-execution-plan skill. The correct pattern uses templates as research checklists that get filled out to become implementation plans, which then serve as structured inputs to the skill that generates the actual executable plan.

The pattern emerged from examining existing examples: the tool-selection-checklist.md defines questions and research tasks; the whisper-cpp-validation-plan.md shows those questions answered with real findings; and the whisper-cpp-pbc-integration-execution-plan.md is what the skill generated from that input. This three-tier structure separates concerns: templates define *what to research*, implementation plans capture *what was found*, and execution plans specify *what to execute*.

This insight has immediate practical value for creating reusable templates for common operations (tool migrations, feature implementations, infrastructure changes). The template should focus on discovery phases, decision gates, and summary sections optimized for the skill's input requirements—not on bash scripts and validation checklists, which the skill generates.

## Insights

### I.1 - Implementation Plans Are Skill Inputs, Not Skill Outputs

Templates and implementation plans serve as **structured inputs** to the docs-as-code-execution-plan skill. The skill then generates the actual execution plan with bash scripts, validation checklists, and phase markers. Creating a template that includes execution plan structure duplicates the skill's job.

- See [S.1](#s1---tool-selection-checklist), [S.2](#s2---whisper-cpp-validation-plan), [S.3](#s3---whisper-cpp-execution-plan)

### I.2 - Three-Tier Document Hierarchy for Execution Planning

The docs-as-code pattern uses three distinct document types:

1. **Template** - Defines questions to answer and research to conduct (reusable)
2. **Implementation Plan** - Filled-out template with actual findings and decisions (instance)
3. **Execution Plan** - Generated by skill, contains bash scripts and validation steps (executable)

**Connections:**

- Emerged from analyzing [S.1](#s1---tool-selection-checklist), [S.2](#s2---whisper-cpp-validation-plan), [S.3](#s3---whisper-cpp-execution-plan)
- Informed [D.2](#d2---template-structure-focuses-on-discovery-and-decisions)

### I.3 - Actor Labels Enable LLM-Executable Plans

Implementation plans can use actor labels (`[CLAUDE]`, `[DREW]`, `[CLAUDE+DREW]`, `[SUBAGENT]`) to clearly indicate who performs each task. This makes the plan executable by Claude while preserving decision points for human input.

**Connections:**

- Observed in [S.2](#s2---whisper-cpp-validation-plan)
- Applicable to [P.1](#p1---use-case-specific-templates-as-skill-inputs)

## Decisions

### D.1 - Separate Template from Execution Plan Structure

Rewrote the move-tool-to-pbc-template.md to be a research/checklist document rather than a full execution plan. Removed all bash scripts, validation checklists, and phase execution markers. Kept discovery phases, decision gates, and summary sections.

**Rationale:** The docs-as-code-execution-plan skill generates the execution structure. The template's job is to ensure all necessary research is done and decisions are made before the skill runs.

**Connections:**

- Implements [I.1](#i1---implementation-plans-are-skill-inputs-not-skill-outputs)
- Results in [L.1](#l1---dont-duplicate-skill-responsibilities-in-templates)

### D.2 - Template Structure Focuses on Discovery and Decisions

The move-tool-to-pbc template was structured around:

- Phase 1: Tool Discovery (location, contents, PATH)
- Phase 2: Dependency Analysis (what uses this tool, how)
- Phase 3: Target Structure Planning (where it goes, directory layout)
- Phase 4: Migration Strategy (copy plan, PATH update, cleanup)
- Phase 5: Verification Planning (tests to run post-migration)
- Phase 6: Decision Gate (all gates must pass)
- Summary section optimized as skill input

**Rationale:** These phases ensure all information needed for the skill to generate a good execution plan is gathered upfront.

**Connections:**

- Implements [I.2](#i2---three-tier-document-hierarchy-for-execution-planning)
- Pattern documented in [P.1](#p1---use-case-specific-templates-as-skill-inputs)

## Lessons Learned

### L.1 - Don't Duplicate Skill Responsibilities in Templates

The first template attempt was ~400 lines and included full execution plan structure with bash scripts. This duplicated what the docs-as-code-execution-plan skill does. The corrected template is ~300 lines focused purely on research and decision-making.

**Connections:**

- Resulted from mistake corrected via [D.1](#d1---separate-template-from-execution-plan-structure)
- Validates [I.1](#i1---implementation-plans-are-skill-inputs-not-skill-outputs)

### L.2 - Examine Existing Examples Before Creating New Patterns

The correct pattern was already demonstrated in the codebase (tool-selection-checklist → whisper-cpp-validation-plan → whisper-cpp-execution-plan). Reading these examples first would have prevented the initial incorrect approach.

**Connections:**

- See [S.1](#s1---tool-selection-checklist), [S.2](#s2---whisper-cpp-validation-plan), [S.3](#s3---whisper-cpp-execution-plan)

## Patterns Identified

### P.1 - Use-Case-Specific Templates as Skill Inputs

Create domain-specific templates (tool migration, feature implementation, infrastructure change) that:

1. Define the research questions specific to that use case
2. Include decision gates that must pass before proceeding
3. End with a "Summary for Execution Plan" section formatted for skill consumption
4. Use actor labels to indicate human vs. Claude tasks

The filled-out template becomes the implementation plan, which is then fed to docs-as-code-execution-plan skill.
